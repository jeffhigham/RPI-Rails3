it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will
not be deleted. We save your profile information (personality profile results,
etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users
deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us
to maintain their information until they return to Bigger Gains. You will still
have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its
entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Bigger
Gains. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to
reactivate it. You may deactivate your account by sending an email to </span><a

after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies
of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been
shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to our Policy, or it
was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no longer be
associated with that information on Bigger Gains. (For example, if you post
something to our website or blog and then you delete your account, that post
may remain. Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity
theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested. If you have
given third party applications or websites access to your information, they may
retain your information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or
privacy policies.&nbsp; But they will no longer be able to access the information

1. Introduction Questions. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, contact our privacy team through this help page. You may also contact us by mail at 555 Republic Dr. Plano, TX 75074.<br />
Scope. This privacy policy covers all of the Bigger Gains International, LLC website, and blog, and other sites owned and controlled by Bigger Gains International, LLC, hereafter “Bigger Gains”. It does not, however, apply to entities that Bigger Gains does not own or control, such as applications and websites using this Platform. By using or accessing the Bigger Gains website, or the RawPersonality.com website, you agree to our privacy practices outlined here.<br />
No information from children under age 18. If you are under age 18, please do not attempt to register for Bigger Gains or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 18, please contact us through this help page.<br />
Parental participation. We strongly recommend that minors 18 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices. Materials to help parents talk to their children about safe internet use can be found online.<br />
<br />
2. Information We Receive.<br />
Information you provide to us:<br />
Information About Yourself. When you register with Bigger Gains you may provide us with your name, email, gender, and birth date. During the registration process or in taking the RPI™, Raw Personality Indicator™, we give you the opportunity to answer personal questions about yourself. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. When you register, or in the future, you may be asked to provide other information about yourself. This information may include for example, your current city, hometown, family, relationships, networks, activities, interests, and places you visit.  Eventually, you may also be able to provide personal information about yourself, such as your political and religious views.<br />
Content. One of the primary reasons people use the Bigger Gains and affiliated websites is to take the personality profile test… the Raw Personality Indicator™ (RPI™), and to share their individualized results with others. Examples also include when you may share a link, make a comment, or send someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with content you share on the Bigger Gains and affiliated websites (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content.<br />
Transactional Information. We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on the Bigger Gains and affiliated websites or affiliated websites. If you do not want us to store your payment source account number, you can remove it by emailing your request to support@biggergains.com.<br />
Information we collect when you interact with Bigger Gains:<br />
Site activity information. We keep track of some of the actions you take on the Bigger Gains website, and the Rawpersonality.com website, such as the results you receive from the completion of the RPI™. We reserve the right to send you messages, based on your individualized results.<br />
Access Device and Browser Information. When you access the Bigger Gains and affiliated websites from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.<br />
Cookie Information. We use “cookies” (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make the Bigger Gains and affiliated websites easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and Bigger Gains. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to the Bigger Gains website. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into the Bigger Gains website, and to know when you are interacting with other Bigger Gains Platform applications and websites, and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use the Bigger Gains website.<br />
Information we receive from third parties:<br />
Information from other websites. We may engage in association with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us:<br />
We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn’t see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as “conversion metrics,” helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see.<br />
We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.<br />
<br />
3. Sharing information on Bigger Gains and affiliated websites. This section explains how your information is shared on the Bigger Gains website.  You should always consider our privacy policy before sharing information on the Bigger Gains website.<br />
Contact Information. Remember that none of this information is required except for your email address and first name, and you do not have to share your email address and first name with anyone.<br />
Comments by Me. You agree that your comments posted on the Bigger Gains and affiliated websites will become usable by Bigger Gains, and may be deleted at the sole discretion of Bigger Gains<br />
Minors. We reserve the right to add special protections for minors (such as to provide them with an age-appropriate experience) and place restrictions on their user experience on the Bigger Gains and affiliated websites.<br />
<br />
4. Information You Provide to Third Parties<br />
Advertisements. Sometimes the advertisers who present ads on Bigger Gains use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. You may use your browser cookie settings to limit or prevent the placement of cookies by advertising networks.  Bigger Gains does not share personally identifiable information with advertisers unless we get your permission.<br />
Links. When you click on links on Bigger Gains you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements.<br />
<br />
5. How We Use Your Information We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:<br />
To manage the service. We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Policies. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.<br />
To contact you. We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all communications from Bigger Gains by sending an email to unsubscribe@biggergains.com.  We may include content you see on Bigger Gains in the emails we send to you.<br />
To serve personalized advertising to you. We don’t share your information with advertisers without your consent. (An example of consent would be if you asked us to provide your shipping address to an advertiser to receive a free sample.) We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, we might use your interest in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not tell the soccer equipment company who you are. We may also use your individualized personality profile test results from the RPI™ to send you messages or advertisements. Even though we do not share your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.<br />
Memorializing Accounts. If we are made aware that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the user’s account. We may close an account if we receive a formal request from the user’s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.<br />
<br />
6. How We Share Information<br />
We share your information with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so. For example:<br />
When you make a payment. When you enter into transactions with others or make payments on Bigger Gains, we will share transaction information with only those third parties necessary to complete the transaction.  We will require those third parties to agree to respect the privacy of your information.<br />
When you invite someone to join. When you ask us to invite someone to join Bigger Gains, we will send them a message on your behalf using your name.  The invitation may also contain information about other users your invitee might know.  We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. If your friend does not want us to keep their information, we will also remove it at their request. Just send an email to unsubscribe@biggergains.com.<br />
When you choose to share your information with marketers. You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers that are not associated with Bigger Gains through on-site offers. This is entirely at your discretion and we will not provide your information to these marketers without your consent.<br />
To help improve or promote our service. Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information.<br />
To provide you with services. We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host our website, send out email updates about Bigger Gains, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links (including sponsored links). These service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.<br />
To advertise our services. We may ask advertisers outside of Bigger Gains to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.<br />
To offer joint services. We may provide services jointly with other companies. If you use these services, we may share your information to facilitate that service.<br />
To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Policies. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.<br />
Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.<br />
<br />
7. How You Can Change or Remove Information<br />
Editing your profile. You may change or remove your profile information at any time by sending an email to support@biggergains.com. Information will be updated within 3 business days.<br />
Delete uploaded contacts. If you use our contact importer to upload addresses, you can later delete the list on this help page.  You can delete the email addresses of friends you have invited to join Bigger Gains on your invite history page.<br />
Deactivating or deleting your account. If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information (personality profile results, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to Bigger Gains. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Bigger Gains. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it. You may deactivate your account by sending an email to deactivate@biggergains.com or delete your account by sending an email to unsubscribe@biggergains.com.<br />
Limitations on removal. Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to our Policy, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information on Bigger Gains. (For example, if you post something to our website or blog and then you delete your account, that post may remain. Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your information, they may retain your information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.  But they will no longer be able to access the information through our Platform after you disconnect from them.<br />
Backup copies. Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.<br />
Non-user contact information. If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a Bigger Gains user but you want us to delete your address, you can do so by sending an email to unsubscribe@biggergains.com. However, that request will only apply to addresses we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that users provide to us later.<br />
<br />
8. How We Protect Information We do our best to keep your information secure.<br />
Steps we take to keep your information secure. We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Privacy Policy.<br />
Risks inherent in sharing information. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on Bigger Gains will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any policy or security measures on Bigger Gains. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.<br />
Report Violations. You should report any security violations to us at support@biggergains.com.<br />
<br />
9. Other Terms<br />
Changes. We may change this Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by publication here. If the changes are material, we will provide you additional, prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances.<br />
Consent to Collection and Processing in the United States. By using Bigger Gains, you consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.<br />
Defined Terms. “Us,” “we,” “our,” “Platform” and “Bigger Gains” mean the same as they do on the Bigger Gains and affiliated websites and blog and affiliated sites that we control, unless otherwise limited by the context.<br />
